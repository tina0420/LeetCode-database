/*
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

Example:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

OR

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

select ifnull((select distinct salary from Employee order by salary desc limit 1 offset 1), null) as SecondHighestSalary


-- limit a,b -> 跳過a個取出b個
-- limit a offset b -> 跳過b個取a個

-- 條件式回傳null -> ifnull()
